# Coffee Shop App: Role Based Access Management

### Coffee Shop Full Stack
Udacity has decided to open a new digitally enabled coffee shop where students can order drinks, socialize, and study. But they need help setting up their menu experience.

**What will I build?**

*I am to create a full stack drink menu application. The application must:*

1. Display graphics representing the ratios of ingredients in each drink.
2. Allow public users to view drink names and graphics.
3. Allow the shop baristas to see the recipe information.
4. Allow the shop managers to create new drinks and edit existing drinks.

This project demonstrates what I have learned, such as:

1. Implementing authentication and authorization in Flask
2. Designing against key security principals
3. Implementing role-based control design patterns
4. Securing a REST API
5. Applying software system risk and compliance principles
